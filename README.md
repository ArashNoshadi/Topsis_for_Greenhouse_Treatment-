Hybrid TOPSIS Analysis for Ranking Plant-Parasitic Nematode TreatmentsThis project provides a robust Python implementation of TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), enhanced with a Hybrid Weighting System.Designed for agricultural and biological research, this tool ranks the efficacy of treatments (e.g., organic amendments, bioproducts, chemical controls) against plant-parasitic nematodes (like Meloidogyne javanica). It goes beyond simple ranking by integrating subjective expert opinions, objective data variance, and model reliability into a single comprehensive analysis.🚀 Key Features🧠 Advanced Hybrid Weighting EngineUnlike standard TOPSIS calculators, this tool computes the final weight for each trait by combining three distinct factors:Subjective Weights (AHP-based): User-defined weights reflecting expert priorities (read from Excel).Objective Weights (Shannon Entropy): Automatically calculated based on the data's information content (divergence).Reliability Factor (Error Correction): Penalizes traits with high predictive errors (using an inverse function: $W \propto \frac{1}{1 + Error}$).📊 Full TOPSIS ImplementationCalculates Normalized Decision Matrix, Weighted Normalized Matrix, PIS (Positive Ideal Solution), and NIS (Negative Ideal Solution).Generates a final Composite Score ($C_i$) for ranking.🛠️ Automated & ConfigurableExcel Integration: Reads data, weights, directions, and error metrics directly from a single .xlsx file.Smart Direction Handling:Benefit (+): Maximizes traits like 'SFW', 'SDW', 'SL'.Cost (-): Minimizes traits like 'Eggs', 'Galls', 'RF'.Case-Insensitive: Automatically detects columns regardless of capitalization (e.g., "treatment", "Treatment").📈 Publication-Ready OutputsDetailed Excel Report: Includes a dedicated 'Weights' sheet showing the breakdown of AHP, Entropy, and Reliability weights for every trait.Visuals: Generates a high-resolution (600 DPI) bar chart of the rankings.🛠️ RequirementsThe script requires the following Python libraries:pandasnumpymatplotlibseabornopenpyxlBashpip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
⚙️ How to Use1. Prepare the Input Excel FileYour Input.xlsx file should contain a sheet with the following columns:Treatment: Names of the treatments (e.g., 'Control', 'Tervigo').Value Columns: Raw data for each trait (e.g., RF, Eggs, Gall).Weight Columns (Optional): AHP/Subjective weights (e.g., RF-wgt).Direction Columns: + for benefit or - for cost (e.g., RF-drc).Error Columns (Optional): Model error metrics (e.g., RF-err). Used for reliability correction.2. Configure the ScriptOpen the script and update the Configuration block at the top:Python# File Paths
IN_PATH = "data/Input.xlsx"   # Path to your input file
OUT_DIR = "results/v1"        # Output folder

# Trait Mapping
TRAITS_RAW = {
    "RF":   {"weight_col": "RF-wgt", "direction_col": "RF-drc", "error_col": "RF-err"},
    "Eggs": {"weight_col": "Eggs-wgt", "direction_col": "Eggs-drc", "error_col": "Eggs-err"},
    # ... add other traits here
}
3. Run the AnalysisBashpython hybrid_topsis.py
📊 OutputsUpon execution, the script generates three files in your output directory:scored_results.xlsx:Sheet 'Results': The main ranking table with composite scores, ranks, and normalized values.Sheet 'Weights': A transparent breakdown of how the final weights were derived (AHP × Shannon × Reliability).scored_results.txt: A tab-separated text file of the main results for easy import into other statistical software (SAS, SPSS, R).composite_scores.png: A professional horizontal bar chart visualizing the treatment rankings.📫 Author & ContactDeveloped by: Arash NoshadiContact: Nowshadiarash@gmail.comLicense: MIT LicenseDOI:
